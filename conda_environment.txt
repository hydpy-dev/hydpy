We should place the following installation instructions for developers into the main documentation soon...

We assume, there is a working Anaconda or Miniconda distribution on your system.

The following command creates the conda environment "hydpy37" installing Python 3.7
(at the time of writing, 3.7.6 is the latest bugfix version of Python 3.7)con:

conda create -n hydpy37 python==3.7.6

You can create parallel environments relying on different Python versions.  At the time of writing, we still support Python 3.6 and are going to support Python 3.8 soon:

conda create -n hydpy36 python==3.6.10
conda create -n hydpy38 python==3.8.1

Now you can activate (one of) the freshly prepared environment(s):

activate hydpy37

Add the "conda-forge" channel to widen the range of available libraries:

conda config --add channels conda-forge

Now you can install most dependencies required for developing HydPy:

conda install bokeh coverage Cython matplotlib netcdf4 numpy pandas setuptools typing_extensions scipy wheel wrapt xmlschema ipython jupyter mypy pylint cycler six kiwisolver pyparsing python-dateutil cftime pytz elementpath markupsafe pyyaml packaging attrs pillow tornado xlrd sphinx sphinxcontrib-fulltoc sympy networkx mathjax line_profiler

Some dependencies are not available via conda and must be installed via pip:

pip install johnnydep sphinxprettysearchresults
