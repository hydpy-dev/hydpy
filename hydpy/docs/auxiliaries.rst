Auxiliary Modules
=================


The `auxs` subpackage provides features that are not essential for the
functionality of :ref:`HydPy` in general, but possibly provide help when
implementing new models or writing :ref:`HydPy` workflow scripts.

Albeit of the small number of modules contained in subpackage `auxs`
so far, the features they provide are very diverse.  A short look
into the general description of each module should help to find out
what purpose it could serve.
