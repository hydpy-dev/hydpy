HydPy-Exch
==========

The `HydPy-Exch` model family enables instances of other model types to exchange
information.   Usually, model instances eventually receive inflow and pass
outflow to other models without knowing anything about them.  One exception is
the highly specialised application model |dam_v004|, which calculates its
discharge to a |dam_v005| instance based on some knowledge of the other model's
internal state.  The purpose of `HydPy-Exch` is to facilitate similar exchanges
between different model instances more modularly. Application model |exch_v001|,
for example, simulates a weir.  Conceptionally, it enables a bidirectional water
exchange between two lakes, where the flow direction depends on the difference
of the lakes' water levels.  Technically, we can combine |exch_v001| with all
model types calculating (something like) water level information and accepting
an additional inlet that can supply positive and negative values.  Due to this
flexible approach, we do not need to implement the weir formula to different
|dam| models.  On the downside, this looser coupling often comes with some
limitations.  One example is numerical accuracy, which might be suboptimal due
to solving the interconnected differential equations of different model
instances sequentially (we might improve this later).
