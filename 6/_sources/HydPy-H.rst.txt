HydPy-H (HBV)
=============

*HydPy* implements a very close emulation of the central routines of the famous HBV96
model, introduced by :cite:t:`ref-Lindstrom1997HBV96`.  As discussed by
:cite:t:`ref-Tyralla2013`, the results of |hland_96| and the IHMS-HBV96 implementation
of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute agree very well for the tested
river basins.  This documentation focusses on technical aspects of HydPy-H and tries to
be as precise as possible regarding the implementation of the process equations.  The
background of the scientifical development of the HBV96 model is more thoroughly
covered in :cite:t:`ref-Lindstrom1997HBV96`.
