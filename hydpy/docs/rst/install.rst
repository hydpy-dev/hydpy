Installation Instructions
=========================

Starting with version, 3.0 *HydPy* is available on the `Python Package Index`_.
With `Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10`_ on your computer and having access to the
internet, you only have to type::

  pip install hydpy

into your command-line tool to install the latest version of *HydPy* on your
computer.  `pip` then installs necessary site packages like `numpy`_ on the
fly.

For 64 bit Windows, the `Python Package Index`_ provides so-called "wheels",
which include pre-compiled binaries and simplify installing a lot.  On Linux
systems, you have to install "from source" at the moment, as explained below.

Starting with version 4.0, *HydPy* also comes as an installer for Windows,
including Python itself and all required and optional dependencies.  You may
find it useful if you are new to Python and want to check out *HydPy* before installing
a complete Python distribution or if you are afraid to mess up your current
Python installation (but then you should probably prefer to work in a virtual
environment).  Additionally, the closedness of the installer might be
preferable when coupling *HydPy* to other software systems such as `Kalypso`_
or `Delft-FEWS`_.  See `releases`_ for the latest version of the *HydPy*
installer.


Selecting a Python distribution
--------------------------------

Using *HydPy* requires installing `Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10`_ first.  You
should favour the latest Python version unless you plan to use other libraries
still only available for earlier versions.  Alternatively, consider installing
a more comprehensive Python distribution like `Anaconda`_, already containing
many scientific and mathematical tools.

Note that these Python distributions do not include the most powerful
integrated development environments.  For simple tasks, the lightweight IDE
`IDLE`_ of the original Python distribution might be sufficient.  `Anaconda`_
also comes with `Spyder`_, which helps structure medium-sized projects.
On the other hand, external IDEs like `PyCharm`_ offer significantly more
comfort, so the initial installation and configuration effort required should
quickly pay for itself.


Selecting a HydPy distribution
------------------------------

If you want to contribute to the development of  *HydPy* or implement new
models, please see the :ref:`development` section.  If you want to apply
*HydPy* only, you should start with a stable version available under
`releases`_.

You are probably interested in using the latest version of *HydPy*, which has
the highest version number.  HydPy's version numbers consist of three separate
digits.  In "X.Y.Z.", "X" is the major number.  There can be substantial
differences between *HydPy* versions with different major numbers, possibly
resulting in incompatibility issues with interfacing systems.  "Y" is the minor
revision number, indicating some improvements, but no potentially problematic
changes, e. g. the implementation of additional models.  "Z" is the revision
number, indicating some necessary corrections to the framework or its
implemented models.  You should make sure to select the highest revision number
available, meaning you should prefer using "X.Y.1" over "X.Y.0".

Each release is available in different compressed archives, corresponding to
different environments.  Currently, we distribute pre-compiled binaries for
64-bit Windows only (see above).  You have to build binaries yourself for all
other operating systems and Python versions yourself.   Principally, this
should be simple, but Windows users might need to install the suitable compiler
first (see below).  Download and uncompress the `source code` archive in an
arbitrary folder and open the command line interface within the uncompressed
`hydpy` folder. Then write the following commands::

    python prepare_build.py
    python -m build
    python -m pip install hydpy --no-index --find-links dist

The first command auto-generates some additional source files.  The second
command uses the original and the autogenerated sources to build a compressed
source distribution and a wheel distribution in a folder named "dist".  The
wheel distribution contains the content of the source distribution plus
pre-compiled binaries for your specific system and `Python` version.  The third
command installs the wheel into the currently active site-packages folder.
After that, you are ready to go.


Selecting a C Compiler
----------------------

You only need to care about selecting a C compiler if no pre-compiled binaries
are available for your system or if you want to implement new models into the
*HydPy* framework.  Also, Linux users should have no trouble, as the `GNU
Compiler Collection`_ is ready for use on standard Linux distributions.
Unfortunately, Windows does not include compilers by default.  Search the
`Windows Compilers page`_ on selecting and installing the correct compiler.

After installing the required compiler on Windows, you might eventually have to
deal with the **unable to find vcvarsall.bat** problem.  `vcvarsall` is a batch
file Python needs to control the installed Visual Studio compiler.  Find this
file on your system and set a new system variable pointing to its path.  A
quick search on the internet should provide you with the required information.
