HydPy-Meteo
===========

The `HydPy-Meteo` model family provides models that calculate meteorological factors.
One example is |meteo_v001|, which calculates global and clear sky solar radiation.
Application models of other model families, for example, |evap_fao56|, require such
factors as input.  Users can either prepare the complete time series of these factors
during preprocessing and let |evap_fao56| read them from files before or during a
simulation or couple |meteo_v001| and |evap_fao56| to calculate global and clear sky
radiation "on the fly".
