Auxiliary Tools
===============

The `auxs` subpackage provides features that are not essential for the functionality of
HydPy in general, but possibly help when implementing new models or writing workflow
scripts.

The available `auxs` modules cover diverse topics, ranging from hydrological approaches
like calculating Unit Hydrograph ordinates (|iuhtools|) to technical issues like
parsing XML workflow files (|xmltools|). A short look into each module's general
description should help determine its purpose.
