"""Submodel for querying the current water level from a remote node.

|exch_waterlevel| informs its main model about the current water level simulated by
another model or passed in as a time series by the user.  Use it, for example, to
couple |wland_v001| and |dam_pump| so that the water level at a pumping station
(modelled by |dam_pump|) can affect the upstream groundwater level (modelled by
|wland_v001|).

Integration test
================

.. how_to_understand_integration_tests::

The only functionality of |exch_waterlevel| is querying water levels from a remote
node.  Hence, we include such a node in the following simple test setting, which does
not require further explanation:

>>> from hydpy.models.exch_waterlevel import *
>>> parameterstep()
>>> from hydpy import Element, Node
>>> node = Node("node", variable="WaterLevel")
>>> element = Element("element", receivers=node)
>>> element.model = model

>>> from hydpy import IntegrationTest, pub
>>> pub.timegrids = "2000-01-01", "2000-01-03", "1d"
>>> test = IntegrationTest(element)
>>> test.dateformat = "%Y-%d-%m"


.. integration-test::

    >>> node.sequences.sim.series = [2.0, 4.0]
    >>> test()
    |       date | node |
    ---------------------
    | 2000-01-01 |  2.0 |
    | 2000-02-01 |  4.0 |

>>> from hydpy import round_
>>> round_(model.get_waterlevel_v1())
4.0
