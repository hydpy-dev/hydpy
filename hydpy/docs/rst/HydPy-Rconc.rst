HydPy-Rconc
===========

All `HydPy-Rconc` models are submodels that calculate runoff concentration by either
the convolution of a unit hydrograph or the linear storage cascade approach
(Nash-Cascade).

Base model:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   rconc

Application model:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Rconc-UH <rconc_uh>
   Rconc-Nash <rconc_nash>
