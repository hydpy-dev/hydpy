User Guide
==========

This user guide build the bridge between the brief :ref:`quick start section
<quickstart>` and the highly comprehensive :ref:`reference manual <reference_manual>`.
It should enable beginners to develop an understanding of HydPy's core ideas and
concepts and use its essential features.

It covers the following topics:

 * The :ref:`how_to_read_the_reference_manual` section explains some aspects of the
   reference manual that are typical for Python libraries but less typical for
   hydrological model descriptions.
 * The :ref:`definitions` section lists and explains the most important Python and
   HydPy frequently used in this document.
 * The :ref:`model_overview` section briefly introduces HydPy's model collection and so
   is a good preparation before reading the detailed model descriptions in the
   reference guide's :ref:`model_families` section.
 * The :ref:`project_structure` section describes the typical directory and file
   structure of HydPy projects.
 * The :ref:`options` section explains how to set the most user-relevant general HydPy
   options and where to find their documentation.
 * The :ref:`simulation` section summarises the basic steps to perform a simulation run
   via Python skripts or XML files.
