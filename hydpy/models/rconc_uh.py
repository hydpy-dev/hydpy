"""Calculate runoff concentration by convolution of the isosceles triangular
unit hydrograph.

|rconc_uh| is a submodel that supports its main model by calculating runoff
concentration using the unit hydrograph approach. It allows for different unit
hydrograph shapes, which can be configured based on specific geometries or wholly
customised. One example of a specific geometry is the isosceles triangle of HBV96
:cite:p:ref-Lindstrom1997HBV96. See the documentation on parameter |UH| for further
information. Also, see the integration tests of application model |hland_v1|, which
use |rconc_uh| as a submodel.
