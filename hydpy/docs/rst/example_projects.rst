LahnH
______

LahnH is a complete project data set for the German river Lahn, provided by the `German
Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG)`_.  The Lahn is a medium-sized tributary to the
Rhine.  The given project configuration agrees with the BfG's forecasting model, using
HBV96 to simulate the inflow of the Rhine's tributaries.  The catchment consists of
four sub-catchments, each with a river gauge (Marburg, Asslar, Leun, Kalkofen) at its
outlet.  The sub-catchments consist of a different number of zones.
