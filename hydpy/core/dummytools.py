class Dummies:
    """Handles "global" doctest data.

    A typical use pattern is to generated the instance of a class in the
    main docstring of the class and to test the different class methods
    based on this instance in separate docstrings afterwards.

    Class |Dummies| tries to ensure that the original objects are
    not altered due to performing different tests.  This protection
    mechanism is successfull for the simple following test class:

    >>> class Test:
    ...
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.name = 'some_name'
    ...         self.values = [1, 2, 3]

    As shown by the following results, neither the name nor the values of
    `dummies.test` can be altered by changing the respective
    attributes of the local object `test`:

    >>> from hydpy import dummies
    >>> dummies.test = Test()
    >>> test = dummies.test
    >>> test.name = 'different_name'
    >>> dummies.test.name
    'some_name'
    >>> test.values[1] = 4
    >>> dummies.test.values
    [1, 2, 3]

    The show pretection mechanism is implemented via making "deep copies"
    of objects handled by |Dummies| objects.  So lets see what happens
    when we subclass the test class and disable deep copying:

    >>> class Test(Test):
    ...
    ...     def __deepcopy__(self, dict_):
    ...         raise NotImplementedError()

    Repeating the the above examples still shows that attribute `name` is
    still protected but attribute `values` is not, meaning `test` is only
    a flat copy of `dummies.test`:

    >>> from hydpy import dummies
    >>> dummies.test = Test()
    >>> test = dummies.test
    >>> test.name = 'different_name'
    >>> dummies.test.name
    'some_name'
    >>> test.values[1] = 4
    >>> dummies.test.values
    [1, 4, 3]

    When we also disable flat copying, neither the name nor the values
    of `dummies.test` are protected:

    >>> class Test(Test):
    ...
    ...     def __copy__(self):
    ...         raise NotImplementedError()

    >>> from hydpy import dummies
    >>> dummies.test = Test()
    >>> test = dummies.test
    >>> test.name = 'different_name'
    >>> dummies.test.name
    'different_name'
    >>> test.values[1] = 4
    >>> dummies.test.values
    [1, 4, 3]

    After each test of a complete module, the dummy object is empty again
    (except for variable names starting with two underscores).
