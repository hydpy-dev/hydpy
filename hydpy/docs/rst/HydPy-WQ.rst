HydPy-WQ
========

All `HydPy-WQ` models are "function-like" submodels that calculate discharge based on
information like the current water level, as needed, for example,  for flood routing.
We intend to increase the number of available submodels and possible main models
step-wise to give users more freedom in choosing the preferred approach.
