Simulation
==========

This section explains the basic principles of configuring a simulation run via Python
scripts or XML files.  The focus lies on the more central methods, especially those
provided by the class |HydPy|.

.. _simulation_python:

Python
______

The :ref:`Quick Start's <quickstart>` :ref:`run_hydpy` section demonstrates the
straightest way to perform a simulation via the Python shell or a Python script without
deviating from any default settings.  Here, we split the procedure into smaller steps
to discuss more details about using a project's data to set a HydPy instance in a
simulation-ready state.   Also, we give some first ideas about possible modifications
and ways to save simulation results.

Please unzip the :ref:`HydPy-H-Lahn` example project into your preferred working
directory and define the `workingdir` variable as exercised in the :ref:`quickstart`
section:

>>> workingdir = "C:/temp"

.. testsetup::

    >>> from hydpy import TestIO
    >>> TestIO.clear()
    >>> from hydpy.core.testtools import prepare_full_example_1
    >>> prepare_full_example_1()
    >>> import os
    >>> cwd = os.getcwd()
    >>> from hydpy.tests import iotesting
    >>> workingdir = iotesting.__path__[0]
    >>> os.chdir(workingdir)

Proceed like in the :ref:`quickstart` section by activating the working directory,
importing |HydPy| and |pub|, initialising a |HydPy| instance, and defining the period
to consider:

>>> import os
>>> os.chdir(workingdir)
>>> from hydpy import HydPy, pub
>>> hp = HydPy("HydPy-H-Lahn")
>>> pub.timegrids = "1996-01-01", "1997-01-01", "1d"

We now define a small helper function that checks if a directory or file we are talking
about exists:

>>> def assert_exists(*components):
...     components = (workingdir,) + components
...     path = os.path.join(*components)
...     assert os.path.exists(path)

First, we must prepare the network. All loadable networks are usually within the
`network` subfolder:

>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "network")

The |NetworkManager| instance of the |pub| object can give us more information.  For
example, it can tell us that the :ref:`HydPy-H-Lahn` project only comprises one
subfolder and hence only one "network version":

>>> pub.networkmanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(default=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/network/default)
>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "network", "default")

The |NetworkManager| instance assumes this single directory as the desired working
directory:

>>> assert pub.networkmanager.currentdir == "default"

The default directory consists of three Python files, for example, `headwaters.py`:

>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "network", "default", "headwaters.py")

If we call method |HydPy.prepare_network|, HydPy builds a network that consists of all
the elements and nodes defined in these three files:

>>> hp.prepare_network()
>>> hp.nodes
Nodes("dill_assl", "lahn_kalk", "lahn_leun", "lahn_marb")
>>> hp.elements
Elements("land_dill_assl", "land_lahn_kalk", "land_lahn_leun",
         "land_lahn_marb", "stream_dill_assl_lahn_leun",
         "stream_lahn_leun_lahn_kalk", "stream_lahn_marb_lahn_leun")

Besides this, the |Selections| instance of |pub| now contains three user-defined
|Selection| instances:

>>> pub.selections
Selections("headwaters", "nonheadwaters", "streams")

Each user-defined selection corresponds to one network file, meaning it has the same
name and comprises the same nodes and elements:

>>> pub.selections.headwaters
Selection("headwaters",
          nodes=("dill_assl", "lahn_marb"),
          elements=("land_dill_assl", "land_lahn_marb"))

A fourth selection, named "complete", is also accessible.  The property
|Selections.complete| creates it automatically upon request by combining the contents
of the user-defined selections.  Right after calling |HydPy.prepare_network|, the
|HydPy| instance and |Selections.complete| have the same nodes and elements:

>>> assert hp == pub.selections.complete

Use method |HydPy.update_devices| to concentrate only on a part of the complete
network.  Here, we restrict the simulation to the headwater catchments:

>>> hp.update_devices(selection=pub.selections.headwaters)
>>> assert hp == pub.selections.headwaters

So far, we prepared the network and selected the subnetwork we are interested in, but a
model that could perform any actual simulation is still missing:

>>> from hydpy import attrready
>>> assert not attrready(hp.elements.land_dill_assl, "model")

The |ControlManager| instance of |pub| informs us about the only available set of model
types and parameterisations, which is available in a directory named `default`, the now
relevant working directory:

>>> pub.controlmanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(default=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/control/default)
>>> assert pub.controlmanager.currentdir == "default"

This directory contains one Python file for each element of the current selection, for
example, `land_dill_assl.py`:

>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "control", "default", "land_dill_assl.py")

Calling method |HydPy.prepare_models| lets HydPy execute these files to create the
required main models and their submodels, which it then connects to the respective
elements:

>>> hp.prepare_models()
>>> model = hp.elements.land_dill_assl.model
>>> model
hland_96
    aetmodel: evap_aet_hbv96
        petmodel: evap_pet_hbv96
    rconcmodel: rconc_uh

All parameter values are already set:

>>> model.parameters.control.icmax
icmax(field=1.0, forest=1.5)
>>> model.aetmodel.petmodel.parameters.derived.altitude
altitude(420.53445)

However, initial condition values are still missing:

>>> model.sequences.states.uz
uz(nan)

We can use the |ConditionManager| to discover the available sets of initial conditions.
There is only one set, and this is suitable for 1 January 1996:

>>> pub.conditionmanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(init_1996_01_01_00_00_00=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/conditions/init_1996_01_01_00_00_00)

The |ConditionManager| is unique as it differentiates between initial and final
conditions, which correspond to the start and end of the currently selected simulation
period.  If not overwritten by |FileManager.currentdir| (see below), property
|ConditionManager.inputpath| creates the expected path to the input conditions based on
the set |ConditionManager.prefix| (defaults to `init`) and the current simulation start
date:

>>> from hydpy import repr_
>>> repr_(pub.conditionmanager.inputpath)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
'.../HydPy-H-Lahn/conditions/init_1996_01_01_00_00_00'

As for control files, there is also one condition file per element, like, for example,
`land_dill_assl.py`:

>>> assert_exists(
...     "HydPy-H-Lahn", "conditions", "init_1996_01_01_00_00_00", "land_dill_assl.py"
... )

Method |HydPy.prepare_models| sets all condition sequences' values by evaluating the
relevant condition files:

>>> hp.load_conditions()
>>> model.sequences.states.uz
uz(7.25228)

The input time series is the only data still missing to run a simulation:

>>> assert not attrready(model.sequences.inputs.t, "series")

The |SequenceManager| informs us there is only one time series directory, and it is
named `default`:

>>> pub.sequencemanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(default=...HydPy-H-Lahn/series/default)
>>> assert pub.sequencemanager.currentdir == "default"

Reading time series data is a two-step procedure.  First, one calls the suitable
"prepare method".  When called without arguments, methods like
|HydPy.prepare_allseries| (which, as its name suggests, addresses the time series of
all relevant sequences) allocate the necessary space in RAM for handling the time
series data:

>>> hp.prepare_allseries()

The second step is to call the suitable "load methods".  In this example, method
|HydPy.load_inputseries| loads the required (meteorological) input time series:

>>> hp.load_inputseries()

If not specified otherwise, HydPy reads time series from and writes them to ASCII files.
For example, the |hland_inputs.T| time series data of the |hland_96| model instance
handled by the element `land_dill_assl` stems from the ASCII file
`land_dill_assl_hland_96_input_t.asc`:

>>> assert_exists(
...     "HydPy-H-Lahn", "series", "default", "land_dill_assl_hland_96_input_t.asc"
... )
>>> from hydpy import print_vector
>>> print_vector(model.sequences.inputs.t.series[:5])
0.0, -0.5, -2.4, -6.8, -7.8

Class |SequenceManager| provides more options than just the directory-related ones.
For example, you can use option |SequenceManager.filetype| to read discharge
measurement data from the NetCDF file `obs_q.nc`:

>>> with pub.sequencemanager.filetype("nc"):
...     hp.load_obsseries()
>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "series", "default", "obs_q.nc")
>>> node = hp.nodes.dill_assl
>>> print_vector(node.sequences.obs.series[:5])
4.84, 5.19, 4.22, 3.65, 3.61

Finally, with all required preprocessing done, we can conduct the simulation:

>>> hp.simulate()

The :ref:`quickstart` section already touches on plotting simulated and observed
discharge:

>>> figure = node.plot_allseries()

.. testsetup::

    >>> from hydpy.core.testtools import save_autofig
    >>> save_autofig("Asslar_Qsim_vs_Qobs.png", figure)

.. image:: Asslar_Qsim_vs_Qobs.png

We "prepared" not only the meteorological input and discharge observation time series
but also those of all sequences for which this is possible.  This foresighted action
allows to gain insights into many internal calculation details.  For example, we can
plot the time series of the zone-specific state sequence |hland_states.SM| and the
subbasin-specific state sequences |hland_states.UZ| and |hland_states.LZ|:

>>> figure = hp.elements.land_dill_assl.plot_stateseries("sm", "uz", "lz")

There are numerous ways to modify the figure creation process or to change already
created figures.  As an example, we add a custom y-label:

>>> text = figure.get_axes()[0].set_ylabel("storage content [mm]")

.. testsetup::

    >>> from hydpy.core.testtools import save_autofig
    >>> save_autofig("Dill_SM_UZ_LZ.png", figure)

.. image:: Dill_SM_UZ_LZ.png

Besides plotting time series, one might wish to save them for later evaluation.
Refraining from writing simulation results into the input data's directory is
considered good practice.  Hence, we use the |SequenceManager| to create a new time
series directory:

>>> pub.sequencemanager.currentdir = "output"
>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "series", "output")
>>> pub.sequencemanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(default=...HydPy-H-Lahn/series/default,
            output=...HydPy-H-Lahn/series/output)

Analogue to the "load methods", |HydPy| offers multiple "save methods" for writing
simulated (and, if necessary, previously read) time series.  Here, we use method
|HydPy.save_simseries| to write the simulated discharge series of the two selected
nodes:

>>> hp.save_simseries()
>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "series", "output", "dill_assl_sim_q.asc")

Also of frequent interest (for example, in the context of operational forecasting) is
writing the achieved final conditions, allowing us to continue the simulation later
seamlessly.

By default, the |ConditionManager.outputpath| property of class |ConditionManager|
creates the required target directory based on the simulation's end date and informs
you about this action:

>>> with pub.options.printprogress(True):
...     path = pub.conditionmanager.outputpath  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
The condition manager's current working directory is not defined explicitly.  Hence, the condition manager writes its data to a directory named `init_1997_01_01_00_00_00`.
Directory ...init_1997_01_01_00_00_00 has been created.
>>> pub.conditionmanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(init_1996_01_01_00_00_00=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/conditions/init_1996_01_01_00_00_00,
            init_1997_01_01_00_00_00=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/conditions/init_1997_01_01_00_00_00)

If this happens by accident, you can undo it in two steps.  First, set the current
working directory to the freshly created output path (note that we here actually pass
a whole directory path instead of a directory name, which would, for example, allow us
to write data beyond the usual HydPy project structure):

>>> pub.conditionmanager.currentdir = path

Second, apply the `del` statement to remove the unintentionally created directory:

>>> del pub.conditionmanager.currentdir
>>> pub.conditionmanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(init_1996_01_01_00_00_00=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/conditions/init_1996_01_01_00_00_00)

Finally, we can create a directory with the desired name and write the conditions into
it:

>>> pub.conditionmanager.currentdir = "my_conditions"
>>> pub.conditionmanager.availabledirs  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Folder2Path(init_1996_01_01_00_00_00=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/conditions/init_1996_01_01_00_00_00,
            my_conditions=.../HydPy-H-Lahn/conditions/my_conditions)
>>> hp.save_conditions()
>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "conditions", "my_conditions", "land_dill_assl.py")

Note that |ConditionManager.inputpath| and |ConditionManager.outputpath|  now point to
the set working directory:

>>> assert pub.conditionmanager.inputpath.endswith("my_conditions")
>>> assert pub.conditionmanager.outputpath.endswith("my_conditions")

Assign |None| to |FileManager.currentdir| to undo this without removing the directory:

>>> pub.conditionmanager.currentdir = None
>>> assert pub.conditionmanager.inputpath.endswith("init_1996_01_01_00_00_00")
>>> assert pub.conditionmanager.outputpath.endswith("init_1997_01_01_00_00_00")
>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "conditions", "my_conditions", "land_dill_assl.py")


.. _simulation_xml:

XML
___

HydPy's XML support is a convenient alternative for people not interested in learning
Python or for standardised tasks like operational forecasting.  It is not as flexible
as defining workflows in Python scripts, but (except for plotting) supports all
features described above and many more.

HydPy offers so-called "script functions" that users can trigger from external
terminals like the Windows command line.  Regarding the XML support, five of them
matter: |run_simulation|, |xml_validate|, |xml_replace|, |start_server|, and
|await_server|.  The latter two functions deal with the advanced topic of letting HydPy
act as a server that can interact with client programs like `OpenDA`_, which is beyond
the :ref:`User Guide's <user_guide>` scope.  Hence, we will focus on |run_simulation|
in the following and also give some notes on |xml_validate| and |xml_replace|.

The :ref:`HydPy-H-Lahn` example project comes with three working XML files, of which
`single_run.xml` is the only relevant one in the given context (the other two deal with
HydPy's server functionalities):

>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "single_run.xml")

Any XML file compatible with the script function |run_simulation|, like
`single_run.xml`, must comply with the XML Schema Definition file
`HydPyConfigSingleRun.xsd`.  If you work with a capable IDE or XML editor, it uses
these definitions to assist you in writing a new or modifying an existing XML file.  At
the very least, it should warn you if your XML file violates the schema file.

Without a capable IDE or XML editor, or if you want to include automatic XML
validation in your workflow, the script function |xml_validate| (which relies on the
`xmlschema`_ library) might be a good option.  We use it as the first example to
demonstrate HydPy's command line usage.

With a standard :ref:`HydPy installation <installation>` on your computer (and, if
necessary, the right environment activated), you can trigger HydPy with the command
`hyd.py`.  Open a terminal, change into the already prepared working directory, type
`hyd.py`, and press enter::

  hyd.py

In the following examples, we fake the usage of a terminal with the help of function
|run_subprocess|, which runs the given commands in a separate subprocess as if typed in
a terminal:

>>> from hydpy import run_subprocess

If we only type `hyd.py`, HydPy informs us that we must tell it what to do by naming
the suitable script function:

>>> subprocess = run_subprocess("hyd.py")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Invoking hyd.py without arguments resulted in the following error:
The first positional argument defining the function to be called is missing.
...

Use the process's return code to determine whether it was successful.  In this case, it
was not, so the return code is unequal zero:

>>> assert subprocess.returncode != 0

Specifying the relevant script function is not enough, as |xml_validate|
(understandably) must know which file to check:

>>> subprocess = run_subprocess("hyd.py xml_validate")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Invoking hyd.py with argument `xml_validate` resulted in the following error:
Function `xml_validate` requires `1` positional arguments (xmlpath), but `0` are given.
...

After adding the relative or absolute path, |xml_validate| informs us by a message and
a zero return code that `single_run.xml` is valid:

>>> subprocess = run_subprocess("hyd.py xml_validate HydPy-H-Lahn/single_run.xml")
HydPy-H-Lahn/single_run.xml successfully validated
>>> assert subprocess.returncode == 0

Note that "valid" here only means the XML file's compliance with
`HydPyConfigSingleRun.xsd`.  It is still possible that its configurations do not fit
the :ref:`HydPy-H-Lahn` project.  For example, `single_run.xml` could select a
simulation period not met by the available input time series.

With a ready XML file, starting a simulation run via method |run_simulation| is easy:

>>> subprocess = run_subprocess("hyd.py run_simulation HydPy-H-Lahn single_run.xml")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Start HydPy project `HydPy-H-Lahn` (...).
Read configuration file `single_run.xml` (...).
Interpret the defined options (...).
Interpret the defined period (...).
Read all network files (...).
Create the custom selections (if defined) (...).
Activate the selected network (...).
Read the required control files (...).
Read the required condition files (...).
Read the required time series files (...).
Perform the simulation run (...).
Write the desired condition files (...).
Write the desired time series files (...).

The printed response clarifies that |run_simulation| essentially executes the same
steps as we did in the :ref:`Simulation > Python <simulation_python>` section above.

One step that goes beyond the Python example is the creation of selections.
Previously, we only used the already available selection `headwaters` defined by the
network file `headwaters.py`.  The XML file goes further and creates three new
selections by specifying individual elements (`from_devices`), keywords
(`from_keywords`), and other selections (`from_selections`).  All these definitions
occur within the XML element `add_selections`.  The defined selections help configure
the reader and writer XML elements not to read and write data needlessly.

The :ref:`User Guide's <user_guide>` :ref:`options` section provided more introductory
information on configuring XML files.

For purposes like operational forecasting, one might wish to reuse a predefined XML
file with some aspects, such as the simulation period, changed.  For this, HydPy
offers an XML template mechanism.  With `single_run.xmlt`, the :ref:`HydPy-H-Lahn`
project contains one example of an XML template file:

>>> assert_exists("HydPy-H-Lahn", "single_run.xmlt")

This template contains three special XML comments in lines
`<firstdate><!--|firstdate=1996-01-01T00:00:00|--></firstdate>`,
`<prefix><!--|prefix=init|--></prefix>`, and `<zip><!--|zip_=false|--></zip>`.  The
parts `<!--` and `-->` define a usual XML comment. As such comments count as nothing,
|xml_validate| reports the following error when checking `single_run.xmlt`:

>>> subprocess = run_subprocess("hyd.py xml_validate HydPy-H-Lahn/single_run.xmlt")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
failed validating '' with XsdAtomicBuiltin(name='xs:dateTime'):
<BLANKLINE>
Reason: Invalid datetime string '' for <class 'elementpath.datatypes.datetime.DateTime10'>
...
Path: /hpcsr:config/timegrid/firstdate

The HydPy-specific parts, `|firstdate=1996-01-01T00:00:00|`, `|prefix=init|`, and
`|zip_=false|`, indicate that |xml_replace| is supposed to replace the respective whole
XML comment.  In the following example, we pass only data to the argument `zip_`:

>>> subprocess = run_subprocess("hyd.py xml_replace HydPy-H-Lahn/single_run zip_=wrong")
template file: HydPy-H-Lahn/single_run.xmlt
target file: HydPy-H-Lahn/single_run.xml
replacements:
  firstdate --> 1996-01-01T00:00:00 (default argument)
  prefix --> init (default argument)
  zip_ --> wrong (given argument)

Following the printed summary, |xml_replace| used the given value `wrong` for the
argument `zip_` and the default values `1996-01-01T00:00:00` and `init` for the
arguments `firstdate` and `prefix` (one must not define such default values; with a
line like `<zip><!--|zip_|--></zip>` one would always have to pass data for the
argument `zip_`).

Although technically successful, the replacement was flawed because, as |xml_validate|
can tell us, `wrong` is not a boolean value, as would be required:

>>> subprocess = run_subprocess("hyd.py xml_validate HydPy-H-Lahn/single_run.xml")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
failed validating 'wrong' with XsdAtomicBuiltin(name='xs:boolean'):
<BLANKLINE>
Reason: 'wrong' is not a boolean value
...
