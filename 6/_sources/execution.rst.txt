Execution Tools
===============

The `exec` subpackage provides features supporting the execution of different HydPy
functionalities.  Most importantly, they address HydPy's usage via the command line
(see, for example, the entry script |hyd|), its configuration via XML workflow files
(module |xmltools|), and its feature to run as a server (see module
|servertools|).
