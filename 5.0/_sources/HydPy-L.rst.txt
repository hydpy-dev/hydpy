.. _HydPy-L:

HydPy-L (LARSIM)
================

*HydPy* implements a close but not exact emulation of the central routines
of the `LARSIM`_ model, applied by many forecasting centres in Germany and
some neighbouring countries.  The version 1 application models of *HydPy-L*
agree very well with a LARSIM configuration called LARSIM-ME ("ME" stands
for Middle Europe), used by the `German Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG)`_
for calculating hydroclimatic scenarios for large river basins (see e. g.
the `KLIWAS`_ project).

*HydPy-L* is partly based on the original publication on LARSIM (`BREMICKER`_),
the summary of the theory and the range of applications of LARSIM, which is
continuously updated by the LARSIM development community
(`LARSIM-Entwicklergemeinschaft`_), the LARSIM online documentation
(`LARSIM Online-Hilfe`_), and some useful hints of the colleagues of the
LUBW (Landesanstalt für Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-Württemberg)
and the HYDRON GmbH.  Some other parts of *HydPy-L* have been programmed more
independently and were incorporated into the original LARSIM implementation
later.


*HydPy-L* includes three different base models:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   lland (L-Land) <lland>
   lstream (L-Stream) <lstream>
   llake (L-Lake) <llake>


So far, we compiled the following application models:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   lland_v1 (Turc-Wendling, Degree day) <lland_v1>
   lland_v2 (External PET, Degree day) <lland_v2>
   lland_v3 (Penman-Monteith, Knauf) <lland_v3>
   lland_v4 (Penman-Monteith, Knauf, snow interception) <lland_v4>
   lstream_v001 (Kinematic Wave, Manning-Strickler) <lstream_v001>
   lstream_v002 (Kinematic wave, External rating curve) <lstream_v002>
   llake_v1 (controlled lake) <llake_v1>

These application models are stand-alone models.  You can combine them
freely with all other models implemented in *HydPy*.

For reasons of consistency with the original LARSIM implementation,
the names of all parameter and sequence classes are German terms and
abbreviations.  Additionally, the documentation on each parameter or
sequence contains an English translation.
