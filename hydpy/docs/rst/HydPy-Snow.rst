HydPy-Snow
==========

The "HydPy-Snow" model family aims to calculate different kinds of snow accumulation
and melt. Currently only Cema-Neige models area implemented. They work
as stand-alone models.

Base model:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   snow


Application models:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   snow_cn (Cema-Neige) <snow_cn>
   snow_cn_minmax (Cema-Neige with Tmin/Tmax) <snow_cn_minmax>
<snow_cnhyst_minmax>
