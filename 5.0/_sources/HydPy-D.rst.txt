HydPy-D (DAM)
=============

The HydPy-D model family implements dams and similar natural and anthropogenic
flow barriers.

At the current state of development, all its application models rely on an
adaptive explicit Runge-Kutta method. This integration method allows for
performing simulations with adjustable numerical precision. However, it works
best for continuous differential equations. Hence, most process equations of
base model |dam| are either continuous by nature or "regularisable", meaning
one can smooth their discontinuities by a degree one considers useful.

Each application model provides a different combination of control capabilities.
Many take "remote locations" into account, for example, to release additional
water to the downstream river channel to increase water stages at remote gauges.

All application models are tested and ready for use.  However, please note that
some improvements in style and structure (e.g. changes in some variable names)
might be necessary for the future. At the moment, it is a little hard to pick
the correct application model.  We will have to find a way to prevent selecting
a suitable model from becoming too hard when the collection of application
models grows.  For the moment, the following overview over the first five
application models might be helpful:

================================================================= ==== ==== ==== ==== ====
Does the dam model…                                               v001 v002 v003 v004 v005
================================================================= ==== ==== ==== ==== ====
…calculate the demand at a remote location itself?                yes  no   no   no   yes

…lie in a river upstream of the remote location?                  yes  yes  no   no   yes

…tell another model if it cannot supply the remote demand?        no   no   no   no   yes

…discharge to another remote location for flood protection?       no   no   no   yes  no

…ask for additional water supply from a remote location?          no   no   no   no   yes

…allow for discharge from a remote location for flood protection? no   no   no   no   yes
================================================================= ==== ==== ==== ==== ====

These five application models are independent implementations, developed for
the forecasting system of the German federal state of Saxony and run by the
`Landeshochwasserzentrum (LHWZ)`_.  More recently, we added the application
models |dam_v006|, |dam_v007|, and |dam_v008| on behalf of the `German Federal
Institute of Hydrology (BfG)`_.  Conceptionally, these *HydPy* models
correspond to the `LARSIM`_ models "SEEG" (controlled lake), "RUEC" (retention
basin) and "TALS" (reservoir).

|dam_v001| has been the starting point for the development of the other
application models. Hence its documentation is very comprehensive, and it seems
to be a good starting point to become acquainted with any of the application
models prepared so far.
