HydPy-A (RIMO/RIDO)
===================

Many hydrologists use linear system approaches to solve flood routing
problems approximately.  Famous examples are the Unit Hydrograph approach
and the Muskingum flood routing method.  One can understand the Unit
Hydrograph approach as a moving average process (MA), and the Muskingum
method as a mixed autoregressive and moving average process (ARMA).
Unit Hydrographs consist of an arbitrary number of MA coefficients.
The Muskingum method defines three parameters, exactly -  two MA
coefficients associated with the "new" and the "old" flow into the
channel, and one AR coefficient associated with the "old" flow out of
the channel.

The HydPy-A base model supports implementing such methods in a generalised
manner.  Consider using one of its application models when you require a
robust, computationally efficient, easily calibratable approach.  However,
taking nonlinear rating curves or backwater effects into account can be
cumbersome or even impossible.
